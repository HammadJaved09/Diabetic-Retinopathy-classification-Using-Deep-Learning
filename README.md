**Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Using Deep Learning**

This project implements a deep learning–based system for binary classification of retinal images to detect the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy.
It includes a complete preprocessing pipeline, model training scripts, and an inference-ready application.

**🧠 Model Overview**

Two deep learning models were implemented:

EfficientNetB3 (Transfer Learning)

Custom CNN (Baseline)

The EfficientNetB3 model delivered superior performance with high accuracy and robust feature extraction on retinal fundus images.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

EfficientNetB3

OpenCV

NumPy

Flask (for the web interface)

**📊 Dataset**

This project uses retinal fundus images from a publicly available dataset commonly used for diabetic retinopathy research (e.g., APTOS 2019).
Images are preprocessed using cropping, resizing, and normalization techniques.

**✨ Features**

Deep learning inference through web interface

Accurate binary DR detection

Modern transfer-learning architecture

Preprocessing pipeline included

Ready for deployment
